## Step 1 - New App Ideas

## Step 2 - Evaluate and Categorize

### Step 2.1 - Top Two apps
1. Gurbani Search Engine
2. Sikh Hub

### Step 2.2 - Evaluating on top two ideas
1. Gurbani Search Engine
    - **Mobile:** The app's eases-of-use comes with mobile experience. Users prefer to read hymn on a hand-held device. Some functionality like iCloud Backup needs mobile experience. Also it needs isolation from other UI elements like web interface to let user focus.
    - **Story:** This app address and fix various drawbacks in the current implementation of such kind of apps like outdated UI, not easy to use. It encourage user to be in a higher state of mind.
    - **Market:** Although the market is majority of sikh diaspora , but its no means a small population scattered worldwide.
    - **Habit:** The app is addictive to the niche group of people who see value in it. Average use of the app is around 2-3 times a day for 2-3 hours.
    - **Scope:** The most challenging part is creating or obtaining the correct database. Alpha versions will be using a dummy placeholder data to represent the functionality. The product is very thoughtfully designed with multiple revisions.

2. Sikh Hub
    - **Mobile:** It could be better suited for webUI.
    - **Story:** It has huge potential to support the community.
    - **Market:** Anyone can sign-up and use it world-wide.
    - **Habit:** It doesn't make habits, but it create opportunities.
    - **Scope:** It will be very challenging to impliment any part of the app as it requires a backed server to host the functionality such as Job-Search. 

### Step 2.3 - Final Decision

I think **Gurbani Search Engine** is the perfect project to get on. It is relatively simple and easy to impliment. It's scope is huge, but I will be starting from bare-bones and slowly improving and adding new functionality in future updates.
